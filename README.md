# DPGO_ROS

## Introduction
This repository implements a ROS wrapper for the DPGO library

## Dependencies
Inside a catkin workspace, please clone the following repositories. Use the default branch unless mentioned otherwise below.
* [catkin_simple](https://github.com/catkin/catkin_simple)
* [pose_graph_tools](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/pose_graph_tools/tree/feature/multirobot): please use the `feature/multirobot` branch.
* [dpgo](https://github.com/mit-acl/dpgo): core C++ library for distributed PGO. 
* [dpgo_ros](https://github.com/mit-acl/dpgo_ros): this repository.

## Building the package

Build with catkin:
```
catkin build
```

To run a demo:
```
# source workspace
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

# run demo on example g2o dataset
roslaunch dpgo_ros DPGO.launch
```
