# DPGO_ROS

## Introduction
This repository implements a ROS wrapper for the DPGO library

## Dependencies
This package assumes that [DPGO](https://github.com/mit-acl/dpgo) has been built and installed, and that a catkin workspace has been initialized.

Before building this package, also clone the the `feature/multirobot` branch of [pose_graph_tools](https://github.com/MIT-SPARK/pose_graph_tools/tree/feature/multirobot) in the same catkin workspace.

## Building the package

Clone this repository:
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/src
git clone git@github.com:mit-acl/dpgo_ros.git
``` 

Build with catkin:
```
catkin build
```

To run a demo:
```
# source workspace
source ~/catkin_ws/devel/setup.bash

# run demo on example g2o dataset
roslaunch dpgo_ros DPGO.launch
```
